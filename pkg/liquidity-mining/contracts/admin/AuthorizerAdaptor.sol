/**
 * @title Authorizer Adaptor
 *
 * WARNING: this contract contains a *critical bug* that can lead into exploits where it checks for permissions
 * incorrectly. It should *never* be used by itself. We keep a copy of it in the repository, including the bug and all
 * original comments (some of which are incorrect due to the bug), both for historical reasons and because it is part of
 * our immutable infrastructure. See the `AuthorizerAdaptorEntrypoint` contract for more information on how we use this
 * contract safely.
 *
 * @notice This contract is intended to act as an adaptor between systems which expect a single admin address
 * and the Balancer Authorizer such that the Authorizer may grant/revoke admin powers to unlimited addresses.
 *
 * The permissions the Authorizer can grant are granular such they may be global or specific to a particular contract
 *
 * @dev When calculating the actionId to call a function on a target contract, it must be calculated as if it were
 * to be called on this adaptor. This can be done by passing the function selector to the `getActionId` function.

        // function selector) given a standard packed ABI encoding. Both the Solidity compiler and clients such as
        // ethers.js will do the ABI encoding in such a way that the selector is actually on slot 100, since this is the
        // way that minimizes gas costs, but it is *not* the only valid way to ABI encode.
        // In particular, it is possible to choose a larger offset and place `data` much further away in calldata. Under
        // those conditions, slot 100 will *not* contain the selector, but it can instead be any arbitrary value. This
        // means that the AuthorizerAdaptor can be made to check for the permission of any arbitrary selector,
        // regardless of the action encoded in `data`.
        //
        // In other words, an account that has permission to execute *any* action via the Adaptor can actually execute
        // *all* of them: there's no permission granularity.
        // Note that actually performing this exploit requires the ability to manually craft calldata: as such,
        // Solidity contracts that call into the Adaptor and create the call via the `abi.encode` function are safe to
        // use since they will always use the standard encoding.
        //
        // To work around this issue, the `TimelockAuthorizer` contract contains a special condition that will check
        // when it is being called by the `AuthorizerAdaptor`, and behave differently when that happens. See the
