# Balancer V3 Vault

This package contains the source code of Balancer V3's main contract, the [`Vault`](./contracts/Vault.sol), as well as its code extensions.

It is generally not used directly, as two other packages should fulfill all development needs:

- To get the Solidity interface of the Vault and related contracts, see [`v3-interfaces`](../interfaces).
- To get the deployment address in all networks, as well as ABIs and tools to deploy to a test network, see [`balancer-deployments` repository](https://github.com/balancer/balancer-deployments).

## Overview

### Installation

NPM package coming soon.
