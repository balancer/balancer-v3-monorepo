/**
 * @dev Base contract for V3 factories to support pause windows for pools based on the factory deployment time.
 * Each pool deployment calls `getPauseWindowDuration` on the factory so that all Pools created by this factory
 * will share the same Pause Window end time, after which both old and new Pools will not be pausable.
 *
 * All pools are reversibly pausable until the pause window expires. Afterward, there is an additional buffer
 * period, set to the same duration as the Vault's buffer period. If a pool was paused, it will remain paused
 * through this buffer period, and cannot be unpaused.
 *
 * When the buffer period expires, it will unpause automatically, and remain permissionless forever after.
