 * @notice Ensure functions in extension contracts can only be called through the main Vault.
 * @dev The Vault is composed of three contracts, using the Proxy pattern from OpenZeppelin. `ensureVaultDelegateCall`
 * can be called on the locally stored Vault address by modifiers in extension contracts to ensure that their functions
 * can only be called through the main Vault. Because the storage *layout* is shared (through inheritance of
 * `VaultStorage`), but each contract actually has its own storage, we need to make sure we are always calling in the
 * main Vault context, to avoid referencing storage in the extension contracts.
