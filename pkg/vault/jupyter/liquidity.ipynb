    "# Weighted Pool Invariant\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of Balancer-like weighted pools, the invariant, often denoted as \\( K \\), is a value that remains constant before and after trades (neglecting swap fees for simplicity). The invariant for a weighted pool is calculated using the balances of the tokens in the pool and their respective weights. The weights are fractions that sum to 1 (or 100%). \n",
    "\n",
    "The invariant is essential for determining the prices of tokens in the pool and for maintaining the value ratios dictated by the weights. The mathematical formula for the invariant is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ K = \\prod_{i=1}^{n} B_i^{W_i} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "\n",
    "- \\( K \\) is the invariant.\n",
    "- \\( n \\) is the number of tokens in the pool.\n",
    "- \\( B_i \\) is the balance of the \\( i \\)-th token in the pool.\n",
    "- \\( W_i \\) is the normalized weight of the \\( i \\)-th token, representing its proportion of the total pool value.\n",
    "\n",
    "This invariant is used in the calculation of trades, liquidity provision, and removal in the pool. It ensures that the ratio of the weights to the balances is maintained, preserving the relative value of each token according to its weight within the pool."

    "# Plotting the Weighted Pool Invariant\n",
    "\n",
    "The invariant for a weighted pool, such as those used in Balancer-like systems, is a constant that represents the state of the pool's liquidity. For a two-token pool, the invariant (`K`) is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ K = B_1^{W_1} \\times B_2^{W_2} $$\n",

    "\n",
    "To understand the relationship between the balances of the two tokens while keeping the invariant constant, we can plot `B_2` as a function of `B_1`. The following Python code uses the `numpy` and `matplotlib` libraries to perform this calculation and generate the plot:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We set the weights `W1` and `W2` for the two tokens, ensuring that they sum up to 1.\n",
    "2. We define an initial balance `B2_initial` for token 2 and calculate the invariant `K` using some initial balance `B1_initial` for token 1.\n",
    "3. We create an array of possible balances for token 1 (`B1_values`) using `numpy.linspace`.\n",
    "4. We then calculate the required balances for token 2 (`B2_values`) to maintain the invariant `K` for each balance of token 1.\n",
    "5. Finally, we plot `B1_values` against `B2_values` using `matplotlib.pyplot`, creating a curve that shows the relationship between the two token balances that maintain the constant invariant.\n",
