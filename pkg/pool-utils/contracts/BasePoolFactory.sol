/**
 * @notice Base contract for Pool factories.
 *
 * Pools are deployed from factories to allow third parties to more easily reason about them. Unknown Pools may have
 * arbitrary logic: being able to assert that a Pool's behavior follows certain rules (those imposed by the contracts
 * created by the factory) is very powerful.
 *
 * Note that in v3, the factory alone is not enough to ensure the safety of a pool. v3 pools can have arbitrary hook
 * contracts, rate providers, complex tokens, and configuration that significantly impacts pool behavior. Specialty
 * factories can be designed to limit their pools range of behavior (e.g., weighted 80/20 factories where the token
 * count and weights are fixed).
 *
 * Since we expect to release new versions of pool types regularly - and the blockchain is forever - versioning will
 * become increasingly important. Governance can deprecate a factory by calling `disable`, which will permanently
 * prevent the creation of any future pools from the factory.
 *
 * Use of factories is also important for security. Calls to `registerPool` or `initialize` made directly on the Vault
 * could potentially be frontrun. In the case of registration, a DoS attack could register a pool with malicious
 * parameters, causing the legitimate registration transaction to fail. The standard Balancer factories avoid this by
 * deploying and registering in a single `create` function.
 *
 * It would also be possible to frontrun `initialize` (e.g., with unbalanced liquidity), and cause the intended
 * initialization to fail. Like registration, initialization only happens once. The Balancer standard factories do not
 * initialize on create, as this would be more complex (e.g., requiring token approvals), and it's very common for the
 * deployment and funding to be performed from different accounts. Also, frontrunning `initialize` doesn't have serious
 * consequences, beyond being a DoS.
 *
 * Nevertheless, this is a factor to consider when launching new pools. To avoid any possibility of frontrunning,
 * the best practice would be to create (i.e., deploy and register) and initialize in the same transaction.
