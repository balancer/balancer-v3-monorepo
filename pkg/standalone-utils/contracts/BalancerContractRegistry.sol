/**
 * @notice On-chain registry of standard Balancer contracts.
 * @dev Maintain a registry of official Balancer Factories, Routers, Hooks, and valid ERC4626 tokens, for two main
 * purposes. The first is to support the many instances where we need to know that a contract is "trusted" (i.e.,
 * is safe and behaves in the required manner). For instance, some hooks depend critically on the identity of the
 * msg.sender, which must be passed down through the Router. Since Routers are permissionless, a malicious one could
 * spoof the sender and "fool" the hook. The hook must therefore "trust" the Router.
 *
 * It is also important for the front-end to know when a particular wrapped token should be used with buffers. Not all
 * "ERC4626" wrapped tokens are fully conforming, and buffer operations with non-conforming tokens may fail in various
 * unexpected ways. It is not enough to simply check whether a buffer exists (e.g., by calling `getBufferAsset`),
 * since best practice is for the pool creator to initialize buffers for all such tokens regardless. They are
 * permissionless, and could otherwise be initialized by anyone in unexpected ways. This registry could be used to
 * keep track of "known good" buffers, such that `isActiveBalancerContract(ContractType.ERC4626, <address>)` returns
 * true for fully-compliant tokens with properly initialized buffers.
 *
 * Current solutions involve passing in the address of the trusted Router on deployment: but what if it needs to
 * support multiple Routers? Or if the Router is deprecated and replaced? Instead, we can pass the registry address,
 * and query this contract to determine whether the Router is a "trusted" one.
 *
 * The second use case is for off-chain queries, or other protocols that need to easily determine, say, the "latest"
 * Weighted Pool Factory. This contract provides `isActiveBalancerContract(type, address)` for the first case, and
 * `getBalancerContract(type, name)` for the second. It is also possible to query all known information about an
 * address, using `getBalancerContractInfo(address)`, which returns a struct with the detailed state.
 *
 * Note that the `SingletonAuthentication` base contract provides `getVault`, so it is also possible to ask this
 * contract for the Vault address, so it doesn't need to be a type.
