# Balancer V3 Stable Pools

This package contains the source code for Balancer V3 Weighted Pools, that is, Pools that swap tokens by enforcing a Stable Math invariant, based on Curve.

Another useful contract is [`StableMath`](../solidity-utils/contracts/math/StableMath.sol), which implements the low level calculations required for swaps, joins, exits and price calculations.
