 * must be restricted to pools that require proportional liquidity operations. For example, the calculated amount
 * for EXACT_OUT withdrawals would be in BPT, and charging fees on BPT is unsupported.
 *
 * Since the fee must be taken *after* the `amountOut` is calculated - and the actual `amountOut` returned to the Vault
 * must be modified in order to charge the fee - `enableHookAdjustedAmounts` must also be set to true in the
 * pool configuration. Otherwise, the Vault would ignore the adjusted values, and not recognize the fee.
