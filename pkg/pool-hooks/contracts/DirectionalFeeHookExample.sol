     *  the rates to be 1:1, which is common among assets that are pegged around the same value, such as USD.
     *  The charged fee percentage is:
     *
     *  (distance between balances of token in and token out) / (total liquidity of both tokens)
     *
     *  For example, if token in has a final balance of 100, and token out has a final balance of 40, the
     *  calculated swap fee percentage is (100 - 40) / (140) = 60/140 = 42.85%
