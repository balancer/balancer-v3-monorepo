/**
 * @notice Increase the swap fee percentage on trades that move pools away from equilibrium.
 * @dev This is most applicable to stable pools with approximately linear math
 * (e.g., with higher amplificationFactor values).
 *
 * This hook implements `onComputeDynamicSwapFeePercentage`, which is called before each swap to determine the final
 * value of the swap fee percentage. If a trade moves the pool balances toward equilibrium, this hook returns the
 * regular static swap fee. Otherwise, it charges a larger fee, approaching 100% as the balance of `tokenOut`
 * approaches zero.
 *
 * Note that this is just an example to illustrate the concept. A real hook would likely be more sophisticated,
 * perhaps establishing a range within which swaps charge the standard fee, and ensuring a smooth and symmetrical
 * fee increase on either side.
