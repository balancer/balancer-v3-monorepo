/**
 * @notice Impose an "exit fee" on a pool. The value of the fee is returned to the LPs.
 * @dev This hook extracts a fee on all withdrawals, then donates it back to the pool (effectively increasing the value
 * of BPT shares for all users).
 *
 * Since the Vault always takes fees on the calculated amounts, and only supports taking fees in tokens, this hook
 * must be restricted to pools that require proportional liquidity operations. The calculated amount for EXACT_OUT
 * withdrawals would be in BPT, and charging fees on BPT is unsupported.
 *
 * Since the fee must be taken *after* the `amountOut` is calculated - and the actual `amountOut` returned to the Vault
 * must be modified in order to charge the fee - `enableHookAdjustedAmounts` must also be set to true in the
 * pool configuration. Otherwise, the Vault would ignore the adjusted values, and not recognize the fee.
 *
 * Finally, since the only way to deposit fee tokens back into the pool balance (without minting new BPT) is through
 * the special "donation" add liquidity type, this hook also requires that the pool support donation.
