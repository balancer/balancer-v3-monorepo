/**
 * @notice  Library for managing sets of primitive types.
 * @dev See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(abstract_data_type)[sets] of primitive types.
 *
 * Based on the EnumerableSet library from OpenZeppelin Contracts, altered to remove the base private functions that
 * work on bytes32, replacing them with a native implementation for address values, to reduce bytecode size and
 * runtime costs.
 *
 * The `unchecked_at` function was also added, which allows for more gas efficient data reads in some scenarios.
 *
 * Sets have the following properties:
 *
 * - Elements are added, removed, and checked for existence in constant time (O(1)).
 * - Elements are enumerated in O(n). No guarantees are made on the ordering.
 *
 * ```
 * contract Example {
 *     // Add the library methods
 *     using EnumerableSet for EnumerableSet.AddressSet;
 *
 *     // Declare a set state variable
 *     EnumerableSet.AddressSet private mySet;
 * }
 * ```
