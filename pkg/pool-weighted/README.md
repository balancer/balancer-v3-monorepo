# Balancer V3 Weighted Pools


This package contains the source code for Balancer V3 Weighted Pools, that is, Pools that swap tokens by enforcing a Constant Weighted Product invariant.

Another useful contract is [`WeightedMath`](../solidity-utils/contracts/math/WeightedMath.sol), which implements the low level calculations required for swaps, joins, exits and price calculations.
