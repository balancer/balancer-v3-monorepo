     * @notice Computes the pool's invariant.
     * @dev This function computes the invariant based on current balances (and potentially other pool state).
     * The rounding direction must be respected for the Vault to round in the pool's favor when calling this function.
     * If the invariant computation involves no precision loss (e.g. simple sum of balances), the same result can be
     * returned for both rounding directions.
     *
     * You can think of the invariant as a measure of the "value" of the pool, which is related to the total liquidity
     * (i.e., the "BPT rate" is `invariant` / `totalSupply`). Two critical properties must hold:
     *
     * 1) The invariant should not change due to a swap. In practice, it can *increase* due to swap fees, which
     * effectively add liquidity after the swap - but it should never decrease.
     *
     * 2) The invariant must be "linear"; i.e., increasing the balances proportionally must increase the invariant in
     * the same proportion: inv(a * n, b * n, c * n) = inv(a, b, c) * n
     *
     * Property #1 is required to prevent "round trip" paths that drain value from the pool (and all LP shareholders).
     * Intuitively, an accurate pricing algorithm ensures the user gets an equal value of token out given token in, so
     * the total value should not change.
     *
     * Property #2 is essential for the "fungibility" of LP shares. If it did not hold, then different users depositing
     * the same total value would get a different number of LP shares. In that case, LP shares would not be
     * interchangeable, as they must be in a fair DEX.
