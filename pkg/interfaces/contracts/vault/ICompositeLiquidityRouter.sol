/**
 * @notice The composite liquidity router supports add/remove liquidity operations on ERC4626 and nested pools.
 * @dev This contract allow interacting with ERC4626 Pools (which contain wrapped ERC4626 tokens) using only underlying
 * standard tokens. For instance, with `addLiquidityUnbalancedToERC4626Pool` it is possible to add liquidity to an
 * ERC4626 Pool with [waDAI, waUSDC], using only DAI, only USDC, or an arbitrary amount of both. If the ERC4626 buffers
 * in the Vault have liquidity, these will be used to avoid wrapping/unwrapping through the wrapped token interface,
 * saving gas.
 *
 * For instance, adding only DAI to the pool above (and assuming an aDAI buffer with enough liquidity), would pull in
 * the DAI from the user, swap it for waDAI in the internal Vault buffer, and deposit the waDAI into the ERC4626 pool:
 * 1) without having to do any expensive ERC4626 wrapping operations; and
 * 2) without requiring the user to construct a batch operation containing the buffer swap.
