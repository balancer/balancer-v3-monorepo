 * @dev Pool contracts with the MinimalSwapInfo or TwoToken specialization settings should implement this interface.

 * Returns the number of tokens the Pool will grant to the user in a 'given in' swap, or that the user will grant
 * to the pool in a 'given out' swap.
 *
 * This can often be implemented by a `view` function, since many pricing algorithms don't need to track state
 * changes in swaps. However, contracts implementing this in non-view functions should check that the caller is
 * indeed the Vault.
